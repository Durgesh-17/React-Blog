        "We’re delighted to announce the launch of another YC Build Sprint through Startup School! It will begin on February 15 and end on March 14. Signups just opened, so you can register for the sprint now.\n\n The Build Sprint is an opportunity for intense focus on your startup or side-project for a specific period of time. For existing startups, this may involve a push towards launching a specific feature or reaching a certain milestone. For new founders, this is an opportunity to take the plunge and begin work on a project that excites you.\n\n At the start of the sprint, you’ll register your four-week goal. As the sprint progresses, you’ll be able to track your progress, get feedback from YC group partners and team members, and have weekly meetings with other sprint participants to provide accountability. The sprint culminates with the YC application deadline.\n\n Getting feedback from YC \n\n One consistent request we get from Startup School participants and YC applicants alike is more feedback from the YC team. For the upcoming sprint, we’re committing to provide more founder feedback than ever before. Each week, we’ll issue a public challenge to sprint participants and give personalized feedback to those who participate. We’ll also have weekly calls with YC partners and experts that will answer participant questions.\n\n Finally, in a first for YC, we’ll provide actionable feedback on 1,0001 YC S2021 applications submitted by sprint participants. Historically, we haven’t systematically provided personalized feedback on applications that don’t make it to the interview stage because of resource constraints. In the spirit of doing things that don’t scale, however, we’re going to get it done!\n\n Want a sprint buddy?\n\n If like many aspiring founders you haven’t gotten started because you haven’t found the right person to work with yet, we’d like to help! As part of Startup School, we recently launched a (still in beta) co-founder matching service. We expect most successful co-founder relationships will take months or years to build a strong foundation, but working on a Build Sprint project together is a great way to stress test a new relationship. If this sounds interesting to you, sign up for Startup School and create a co-founder matching profile now.\n\n Let’s go \n\n Build Sprint signups are open now. Looking forward to seeing you there!\n\n If possible, we’d like to provide an actionable piece of feedback to everyone who completes the Build Sprint and submits a YC application. But we’re not sure how long that will take, so we’re only committing to provide feedback on 1,000 applications for now to be safe. ↩",

        "Running a biotech company is capital intensive, and this can make it intimidating to get started. Founders sometimes face a chicken and egg problem: how do you make progress without millions of dollars in funding, and how do you raise millions of dollars in funding without having made progress?\n\nHowever, it is quite possible today to start a biotech company on a shoestring budget ($0-$200k starting costs). Many successful biotech companies started in just this way.\n\nThis post walks through three such stories, covering three biotech companies that are doing extremely well. Each example explains how they managed to get started and hit initial milestones with minimal funding or without any funding at all.\n\nSpecifically, these case studies will demonstrate answers to the following questions:\n\n1) Can you run initial experiments showing technical feasibility of your idea, like GeneWEAVE?\n\n2) If your target market will be very expensive to enter, can you repurpose your product to go after a smaller, more tractable market initially, like BillionToOne?\n\n3) Can you generate revenue upfront by providing services to other companies that are enabled by your technology, like Arpeggio?\n\nGeneWEAVE\n\nToday GeneWEAVE is a division of Roche, the world’s largest biotech company and leading provider of in vitro diagnostics. GeneWEAVE’s infectious disease diagnostic products are authorized by the FDA and based on technology that was acquired by Roche in 2015 for $425M. They have a unique diagnostic approach: while most use PCR based techniques to diagnose bacterial infections, GeneWEAVE uses phages (viruses that infect bacteria) as the detection mechanism. The main advantage of this approach is faster, easier and cheaper sample preparation that enables rapid results.\n\nThe founding of GeneWEAVE, however, is a case study on focus and scrappiness. Diego Rey, co-founder and CTO of GeneWEAVE needed to show that his phage based diagnostics could work. Intensely focused on demonstrating technical feasibility, he and his co-founders found $75K in grant money and hired a postdoc at Cornell to do the first proof-of-principle study. The study needed to demonstrate that the phage-based bacterial detection technique could work. The initial data took a year to collect, and the results were good. However, this initial data used a lab strain of bacteria and the team had yet to show that the technology could work with bacteria recovered from actual infections — or in their case, drug resistant staph (MRSA).\n\nAt this point, GeneWEAVE set up a chain of experiments, and used each experiment to raise another small round of funding. Their first investor check was for $150K and they used this to generate more data and convince another investor to also invest $150K. This led to the next experiment which got them another $300K and a final proof point that landed them another $300K. By now the team showed that the tech could work with bacteria found in the real world and directly from patient specimens. This was enough to convince Series A investors to fund the company with $12M.\n\nWhat’s notable about GeneWEAVE is not only what they did, but what they did not do. They focused on their proof of principle, and were not distracted by setting up a facility or starting their FDA 510(k). They defined a first specific product (MRSA screening) and focused on producing key data that de-risked the technology and product one step at a time.\n\nBillionToOne (YC S17)\n\nBillionToOne makes diagnostic blood tests. They have raised over $30M and are working on a product to detect cancer using a blood test.\n\nThe BillionToOne blood test works using cell free DNA —that is the DNA that is released into the bloodstream when cells die. Cancer cells have detectable mutations that shed into the bloodstream when the cells die. Theoretically, it would be possible to detect those mutations early via blood draw to determine the correct, personalized treatment for every cancer patient.\n\nWhen getting started, BillionToOne decided not to pursue cancer diagnostics as their first product. Instead, they used their core cell free DNA technology for non-invasive prenatal screening (i.e. determining disease in a fetus from a maternal blood sample), a market much easier to enter due to existing reimbursement rules. Similar to cancer cells, placental cells die and release fetal DNA into the mom’s bloodstream. The technology that would look for cancer mutations instead would look for chromosomal abnormalities, as well as other disorders such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and spinal muscular atrophy mutations in the prenatal use case.\n\nCo-founder and CEO Oguzhan Atay and team joined YC in summer 2017 focused on building a prenatal test. Their prenatal focus was one of the key elements to launching on a budget because prenatal testing can be recommended by doctors and billed to insurance. Though cell free DNA technology can be used to diagnose cancer, the incentives are not yet aligned for a product of this type. For example, there isn’t a CPT code to bill against for a “cancer blood test” for early detection or treatment monitoring, or an agreed upon criteria for testing patients with symptoms for an early diagnosis. Today, cancer screening is intriguing, but a company would have to raise a ton of money to prove diagnostic capability at the level needed to get reimbursed.\n\nBy focusing on prenatal diagnosis, a category with established care patterns and reimbursable by insurance, they could develop their technology and get paid in a year instead of a decade. To ship their first version, BillionToOne recruited physicians and scientists who were interested in sickle cell prenatal diagnosis, and worked with those physicians to run a clinical study to develop their laboratory developed test (LDT). Because those scientists were excited about the promise of the product, they were willing to do the study on a budget, and all-in-all BillionToOne was able to develop their product and complete their clinical studies for around $2M before raising their $15M Series A to set up their CLIA laboratory and commercialize their test.\n\nThe speed and savvy of the team was one of the factors that helped them raise their Series A in 2019.\n\nThere are many lessons in this early life of BillionToOne that is useful for those starting a bio company on a budget:\n\nFinding an initial product that’s reimbursable and then taking the shortest path to get there.\nThinking carefully about your regulatory strategy; in this case pursuing CLIA/CAP first before FDA 510(k) clearance.\nIdentifying and exciting researchers and physicians who are passionate about a disease (in this case sickle cell disease), and working with them to get a study done in a timely and cost effective way.\n\nArpeggio Bio (YC S19)\n\nArpeggio Bio is a therapeutics company that is developing cancer treatments. They are designing oncology drugs that activate specific drug targets — increasing effectiveness and reducing side effects for a drug regimen. Their client list includes some of the biggest pharma companies, including Novartis.\n\nThe early story of Arpeggio is unique in that it was a bootstrapped biotech company. In the beginning, founder Joey Azofeifa was a PhD student who had a few years of pharma work under his belt. He built a platform (hardware, reagents and software) that gave pharma companies the ability to see what targets their drug compound hits and which ones it doesn’t. Before, pharma companies would spend years and lots of money determining that 10% of patients don’t respond to a treatment; with Arppeggio’s tool, they could determine the response to treatments before human testing.\n\nArpeggio’s first customer was one of Joey’s former colleagues. The initial contract wasn’t for technology, but rather a fee-for-service contract where Arpeggio was shipped drug compounds, and in the lab they profiled the compound and the changes it induced in 21k genes using their own tool. From there, the Arpeggio team cold messaged on LinkedIn and asked former colleagues for intros. Through this strategy, they reach close to $1M annual run rate, completely bootstrapped, before applying to YC in 2019.\n\nArpeggio used their own technology to do drug discovery, and sold it as “consulting” to build credibility with investors and trust with a few initial clients.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nContrary to popular belief, it’s possible to start a bio company on a budget. We hope that a few illustrations will encourage more founders to take their first steps.",

        "A frequent question we get at YC is “when do I start thinking about the FDA?” Obviously, there is no single answer to such a complex question, but here are some basic rules of thumb for how to think about it:\n\nIt makes sense for every founder considering a bio product to get a basic FDA education from day one.\nChoosing the proper regulatory pathway is nuanced; research and experts can help.\nCorrectly setting up your GxP process and running studies “the FDA way” at the right time is essential.\nNavigating the FDA process effectively is absolutely key for startups. If you invest too much too early, you may unnecessarily burn cash too fast. Conversely, if you start too late, you may have to redo work, potentially slowing down your process substantially. An analogy we often share with founders is that work done before investing in the FDA process is like sketching with pencil, while committing to the FDA process is like using ink. As you can imagine, planning your sketch and practicing it in pencil, and only then committing to ink, will lead to the best results.\n\nIn our experience, we often see pre-product startup founders pursuing two simultaneous projects:\n\nRunning a “killer” experiment that demonstrates that their product can work.\nFiguring out the appropriate FDA regulatory pathway for their product.\nStartups run these simultaneously because they’re interdependent and because the learnings from the killer experiment often help determine the proper regulatory pathway. Imagine you’ve been iterating on a novel therapeutic in vitro. Your killer experiment might be showing a therapeutic effect by doing an in-vivo experiment in a representative animal model. By getting some sense of the therapeutic effect and its mechanism, you can compare your therapeutic to others with similar safety profiles or that treat similar populations or diseases. This comparison process can help you choose the regulatory pathway that makes the most sense for the product.\n\nOver the years, we’ve watched many startups do a lot of work on their “killer experiments” before deciding on their FDA regulatory pathway. These are some of the approaches we’ve seen YC companies pursue:\n\nIn-vitro experiments at the bench, using banked cells or banked/cultured tissues.\nIn-vivo experiments using animal models.\nIn patient experiments under IRB with physician oversight.\nFinding a non-clinical research use for your technology that does not require FDA approval.\nPursue research, industrial, agricultural, or veterinary applications of technologies that will eventually be used for human health.\nWhen startups have been developing diagnostics, we’ve also seen companies working on tests with a lab component decide to start first with the CLIA/CAP LDT process, and only then pursue FDA clearance. This can be a reasonable choice for certain classes of diagnostic tests as it allows you to start delivering diagnostic results at small scale.\n\nHere are some important questions to consider as you set out on your FDA journey:\n\nWhen should I start doing things the FDA way (e.g. set up GxP, Quality System etc)?\nAs we described in a previous post, doing things the FDA way is vital to getting the regulatory green light you need before you can market your product. It’s time-consuming and complex, entailing setting up your quality system, documenting appropriately, and running studies according to tightly controlled protocols. But doing it the right way will expedite the regulatory process.\n\nThere is no easy answer for exactly when to start doing things the FDA way. Ideally, though, your founders understood at a basic level when they started the company what the process may look like for your product. An early team might have already gathered some data on their product’s safety and efficacy from their killer experiments.\n\nOf course, the cost and time associated with your experiments is often a factor in determining the best time to start doing things the FDA way. A company developing a digital health product will usually start the process sooner than a company developing a therapeutic, because the former requires less time and energy if pivoting becomes necessary. Nevertheless, a good rule of thumb for any company to follow is that when your team feels confident that its technology could work, it’s probably the right time to begin thinking about its regulatory implications. And, it may be a good time to seek feedback from the FDA or counsel from a consultant or lawyer.\n\nShould I hire a consultant or a lawyer?\nStarting the FDA process can be expensive, so doing smart planning and budgeting can help your startup efficiently navigate the FDA process. If you’re an early-stage company who’s raised only a small seed round or less, seeking advice from a regulatory consultant is a good way to get started. Consultants bring a wealth of regulatory experience, but may not be expert in your domain. Ideally an early stage consultant has experience in both your diagnostic or therapeutic area and the regulatory pathway you’re most seriously considering. And of course, they understand many of the financial and regulatory dynamics companies at your stage are grappling with.\n\nTo be sure, consultants have different specialties; some focus on therapeutics while others are experts in medical devices and manufacturing or regulated software. There are frequent discussions within the YC bio community about which consultants are good in which areas. If you can’t identify a consultant who meets all three criteria, you can sometimes use one like a lawyer–as a primary outside counsel who is your go-to FDA resource, while hiring specialists on an as-needed basis.\n\nHowever, while there are exceptions, it’s unusual to hire a regulatory-affairs attorney during your company’s early stages. On the other hand, it’s important to retain an intellectual property lawyer early on. We’ll cover that in a future post.\n\nIs a lawyer better than a consultant?\nEarly stage startup founders often believe a lawyer who specializes in life science regulation is superior to a non-lawyer consultant. Generally, we don’t agree, but a regulatory lawyer can be an immense help when a startup finds itself expecting to challenge an FDA decision such as the agency refusing to sign off on a regulatory pathway for your product while green-lighting a competitor’s process.\n\nWhat can I hire a consultant to do?\nFor many early stage bio companies, a consultant is useful for the following:\n\nDetermining the pros and cons of different regulatory options, such as whether to pursue 510(k) or DeNovo? Or 505(b)(1) or (b)(2)?\nWhether choosing a Pre-sub or Pre-IND would be beneficial for a product like yours. The consultant can also do the filing and request the meeting with the FDA.\nFiguring out what your IND (Investigational New Drug) submission package should look like, including: Is chronic toxicity testing required? How long? Where will it be run? What will your manufacturing look like and where will you do it?\nWhat will your NDA (New Drug Application) require? Can you get an approval in 100 patients, or will you need a 20,000 patient safety database?\nResearching related products to understand the studies they ran, the claims they made, and what their timelines looked like.\nDetermining what suppliers are often needed for your type of manufacturing, clinical research, and the like?\nResearching the statistical techniques you should use, and which bio-statisticians are experts in your area.\nFiling all your clinical and marketing approval submissions until your company hires a full-time regulatory staff.\nDeciding if your product is a candidate for special FDA programs like Breakthrough Designation or The Orphan Drug Act?If you’re going to hire a consultant, you must be able to share the following in order to get the best results:\n\nA full list of the experiments you’ve run so far.\nAn explanation of the diseases or conditions your technology can best attack.\nA complete roster of competing or similar products that are already on the market.\nThe regulatory pathways you believe will best apply to your product.\nAs with any advisor, the more you arm your consultant with relevant and helpful data about what you want to achieve and what you’ve already done, the more valuable she can be for you.\n\nWith this information in mind, you can start planning your next steps and building out a budget and timeline. Remember that good consultants can be incredibly expensive. We often see quotes in the $6,000 to $20,000 a month range for part-time consultants. To best manage your costs, you should have specific outcomes in mind before you hire a consultant. This will help you keep their hours under control.\n\nBecause there are so many consultants and consulting groups, we recommend soliciting leads from your network first. Sometimes, in fields like medical devices, you can find the names of consultants by examining regulatory submission summaries, which are public record.\n\nIdeally, you can find a consultant who’s experienced with your specific regulatory pathway and who also understands your diagnostic or therapeutic area. But remember that medical device consultants, small molecule drug development consultants, and biologics consultants are typically different sets of people.\n\nBy hiring a good consultant and signing a healthy consulting engagement, you’ll be more confident and educated about your regulatory options, the processes you must follow, and your criteria for success. That’s especially true if your consultant can help with aPreSub or Pre-IND process. And while your consultant may be responsible for executing the process, she will not and should not drive the process or specific outcomes. Founders often mistakenly “let the regulatory tail wag the business dog,” so to speak. A good consultant, like a good lawyer, will look to you to define your desired business outcomes and then provide counsel to meet those outcomes as best she can.\n\nOver time, companies typically hire multiple consultants for different functions. But in the early going, when exploring your regulatory options is so important, it’s common to retain just one. Later, though, you may want to think about hiring biostatisticians, clinical study designers, and manufacturing or supply chain consultants.\n\nEnzyme (YC S17) offers consulting services tailored for startups, with particular experience in medical device/diagnostic, combination product and digital health products.\n\nThe first regulatory hire, and staffing a regulatory team\nSometimes, startups can make their way to commercialization using only consultants for their quality and regulatory needs. But eventually this arrangement becomes suboptimal and cost-prohibitive and the startup must hire in-house quality and regulatory people. The specific timing for this evolution depends greatly on the type of products being developed. For example, it’s not uncommon for a therapeutic startup to hire a full-time regulatory specialist as one of the first ten employees. But neither is it uncommon for a digital health startup to wait until they’ve closed their Series B funding to bring on a full-time regulatory hire. Ultimately, the right time to make this transition is dictated by the work underpinning it. But something to keep in mind is that the how of making something and getting it approved is in itself valuable knowledge–and something you want to infuse your company’s DNA with before you embark on your second-generation product.\n\nIt’s important to remember that regulatory and quality leads typically work cross-functionally, and will need to work with team members from product development to marketing regarding compliance. Many quality and regulatory professionals who work with early stage companies are able to “dual-hat”, i.e. perform both quality and regulatory functions, but many specialize and do just one or the other.\n\nHiring someone with regulatory expertise is frequently difficult for first-time founders who haven’t been through the process before, and this specialization can exacerbate the hiring dynamic. Early stage companies have a wide variety of quality and regulatory needs, including maintaining the quality system, leading regulatory filings such as PreSub, Pre-IND, IND, etc., and working cross-functionally to create documentation, standard operating procedures and the like.\n\nThat’s why it’s vital to ensure that someone is tackling your regulatory strategy and filings, and also ensuring that you have and are following a functioning QMS. Making sure you have and are operating under such a system is often considered “the FDA way.”\n\nWhat Investors Will Care About\nGiven the time and expense associated with an FDA approval or clearance, investors want to understand your company’s regulatory story before considering an investment. Regarding your clearance, some of the things they’ll want to examine include:\n\nWhat’s your risk profile? Which regulatory clearance are you pursuing and how likely are you to get it?\nWhat’s the timeline? Where will the company be when it is five years old?\nWhat’s the budget? How much money will it take to get the approval? How much more will you have to raise at the next round?\nHow well do you understand your pathway and the many hurdles you will need to navigate to get approval?\nWhen raising money, you should be able to present clear materials that address these questions with relevant clinical data. We will cover how investors evaluate bio startups in another post.\n\nConclusion\nMany of the decisions you have to make in relation to the FDA and your company’s regulatory needs will be neither simple nor easy to make. We hope this post can:\n\nHelp founders determine their early stage hiring or consulting needs when it comes to the FDA.\nHelp founders understand when the right time is to start doing things the FDA way.\nThere are few clear and obvious answers to the above, but these are discussions we have often in the YC community, and as a result, we’ve developed numerous opinions on these topics by working with founders. We welcome any feedback. Reach out to us on Twitter at @reshmakhilnani and @seehafer.",

        "In the late 1990s, Deryl McKissack visited a high school in Washington, DC, to speak to the student body about her career. At the start of that decade, she had founded her architecture, engineering, and construction management firm in the U.S. capital, inspired by her family’s 115-year-old business. When she walked into one of the school’s restrooms after her talk, McKissack was struck by its deteriorated state. She thought about the young women walking through those doors every day and the effect these conditions could have on their self-confidence — and she realized her purpose as a leader was to improve lives through building and design.\n\nToday, as president and CEO, McKissack sits at the helm of a leading design and construction services group with US$30 million in annual revenue. McKissack & McKissack has offices in Baltimore, Chicago, DC, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Austin, with 150 employees managing $15 billion in construction projects and serving customers across the U.S. and around the globe. The firm, renowned for such landmark projects as the George H.W. Bush Library, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, has been doing steady business during the pandemic as commercial and public organizations rethink buildings and infrastructure for the post-pandemic world.\n\nThe challenges McKissack has faced as the founder of a minority-owned business have instilled an ingenuity and resilience that cascade through her company’s culture, and that have been critical in addressing the evolving needs of businesses and individuals for the physical spaces they inhabit. She sat down for a Zoom interview with strategy + business  to discuss how McKissack & McKissack is adapting to the pandemic’s disruption both internally and as an industry leader.\n\nS+B: Your firm has a unique origin story. Can you tell us about that?\nMCKISSACK: My family’s history in America goes back to 1790, when my great-great-grandfather came here as a slave. He was a builder. He made bricks. He passed this trade down to my great-grandfather, who became a master carpenter, who passed his trade down to my grandfather. My grandfather and his brother started our family business in Tennessee in 1905, making us the oldest African-American architectural firm in the country. In 1922, they became the first licensed Black architects in the Southeast United States. But what put them on the map was the Tuskegee Air Force Base that they designed and built during World War II.\n\nI’m an identical twin, and one of three girls. From the age of 6, I remember going to the office with my twin sister. My father, a registered architect, would prop us up on the drawing boards. He taught us how to draw details, do schedules, use Leroy lettering [a mechanical lettering device], and make legends. He started using the designs we made by the age of 12 for his real work with customers. When we went to college, he met with the deans of the architecture and engineering schools to design a curriculum just for us, enabling us to graduate in both fields. The plan was that we would work in corporate America and bring the best practices back into the family business.\n\nBut then it hit me that I wanted my own little red wagon. I just had this burning passion to see if I could do it. Could I start a company with $1,000? I’d never even written a business plan, so I bought a book on how to do it. Although this is my own company, I consider it an extension of my heritage. Design and architecture are in my blood.\n\nS+B: As the founder and CEO of your business, how do you view your purpose?\nMCKISSACK: Our company’s mission has changed over the years. Initially, I felt if I just followed my ancestors’ approach to be a trustworthy partner who under-promised and over-delivered, I would be successful. But about 15 years into this business, I realized my purpose had to go beyond our own organization’s success.\n\nI remember touring a DC school — the city probably had one of the most dilapidated school systems in the country — and seeing the girls’ bathrooms, which were a mess. Half the toilets were off the wall. The privacy partitions were down. The mirrors were so foggy you could barely see yourself, and the lights were dim.\n\nAt that time, we were working on some new prisons, which looked much better than these schools. I thought: How can wonderful women graduate with a sense of dignity and self-respect under these conditions? That’s when it hit me that our mission had to go beyond bricks and mortar. It had to be about enhancing lives through design and construction.\n\nToday, we have the largest K–12 construction management program in the country. Much of our mission involves making the structure of the buildings more sustainable, using metrics that tell us how much energy is being generated by the geothermal system, for example. These tools, which are visible to the students in these schools, are used as teaching opportunities, as educators incorporate the metrics into courses. We have heard that this has inspired some of them to pursue STEM or engineering careers. Some of the other program management work we are doing now involves COVID-19 mitigation, including upgrading schools’ HVAC systems for better, safer air filtration.\n\nS+B: Of all the challenges you’ve faced since starting your business, the COVID-19 crisis must be like no other. How have the events of 2020 impacted your business and your industry?\nMCKISSACK: Our industry has not been as badly impacted as others because early on, construction was deemed essential. Of course, restrictions have varied state by state, but our clients provided written statements that we were essential, enabling members of our construction teams to conduct business even as everyone else was sheltering in place.\n\nWe’ve been going full speed ahead. Our requests for proposals have increased sharply, and we now have more than 70 active projects, including three 2021 [presidential] inaugural viewing stands that cannot wait. Of course, some of our commercial office space projects have been put on hold.\n\nS+B: What is your company’s outlook for the next few years?\nMCKISSACK: Our customer base is 50/50 government and private. A decade ago, 85 percent of our portfolio was government, with federal, state, and municipal projects. But our board pushed us to add more balance to our portfolio, which has greatly improved our outlook. Initially, I was concerned that the public projects would lag as a result of a reduced tax base, but the shortfall has been nowhere near as big as expected. Meanwhile, so many of the projects we are working on are massive, multiyear, and already funded.\n\nSome of our government clients are also seeing opportunities and want to accelerate the work. Airports, for example, are doing more infrastructure work, taking advantage of the relatively empty spaces. We’re going through a massive renovation at Reagan National Airport, and the low traffic has been a huge help.\n\nOn the private side, business is also robust. We’re seeing continuous demand, particularly in the energy sector, so I’m very optimistic about our near and intermediate future. Energy companies make up about 50 percent of our commercial clients — and the need for reliable and safe energy continues.\n\nOf course, we don’t know where the pandemic is going to go. We may all have to shut down. But even though the construction and design industries are usually not this insulated from downturns, as of now we’re a lifeline. We’re keeping the economy going. I haven’t seen any indication that this won’t remain the case. And the next administration will have to pass an infrastructure bill to put America back to work again, so we’ll be busy.\n\nS+B: How has COVID-19 impacted your approach to public spaces?\nMCKISSACK: Design and engineering are constantly evolving with the times. After 9/11, for example, we were focused on security. Some government buildings ended up looking like fortresses. As time went on, people realized they wanted the security, but they didn’t want to see it. So, we adapted, camouflaging bollards by embedding them into hillsides, for example. For the MLK Memorial, the bollards are benches. And we built a steel wall into ditches disguised by big grassy mounds, so nothing can get through.\n\nIn the same way, COVID-19 is going to influence the design world. I’m not yet sure what that looks like exactly. I know it involves spacing and touchless features. Workplace health, safety, and hygiene expertise will play a larger role in design. Public spaces are going to be a work in progress for some time. Spaces can’t be permanently reconfigured until we know more about COVID-19 and we have a handle on the efficacy of treatments and vaccines. Federal guidelines aren’t even solid on this, and we’ll need to continue to make rigorous hazard assessments.\n\nStill, we know that offices will need better HVAC systems to increase airflow, and more square feet of personal space per individual. They will have more touchless technology, with more cordoning off using plexiglass barriers and physical distance. Break spaces, lunchrooms, and washrooms are hot zones that will require creative work-arounds. Restrooms will need occupant limits with sensor fixtures, including touchless sanitizers. Traffic flow will need to be marked off, and passageways widened. Doorknobs will need to be removed from executive offices.\n\nEven when we get a vaccine, the anxiety isn’t going away. I believe many of these measures will be permanent. Public health officials are speculating that COVID-19 will be endemic, with sporadic repeats thanks to globalization. Of course, we will have more elegant solutions for creating separation. I was recently on a panel for the Center for Innovation in the Design and Construction Industry, and the ideas were inspiring. We will be using drones for tasks like inspecting and documenting construction jobsites, so people won’t have to walk through them — especially when it is dangerous to do so. COVID-19 is causing a giant technological leapfrog into more futuristic spaces.\n\nS+B: How has your experience during the pandemic shaped the way you think about the workplace?\nMCKISSACK: I am old school. I always felt that if people were not in the office, they wouldn’t be accountable, and productivity would go down. And we have beautiful offices! Right before COVID-19, we’d invested in expensive furniture from Italy to create intimate spaces where people could meet over coffee, which of course isn’t happening now.\n\nWhen the lockdowns happened, I was in Miami on a Sunday night ahead of a critical meeting. My COO called and said we would have to do it virtually. I hadn’t realized we’d invested a lot in IT systems and firewalls over the previous two years, so setting up this new way of working was like flicking a switch. Everyone was on laptops from home, but we were all easily connected.\n\nI’ve since done a complete 180. I didn’t sleep that first week of lockdown, worrying about how we were all going to communicate and maintain our momentum. But by Friday evening, I was shocked to realize that everyone was just as productive and, as time wore on, even more so. We didn’t have to get dressed in the morning, do the commute into DC, Chicago, L.A. All that time we wasted in the car is now being spent on our computers.\n\nOf course, that also means we are “on” 24/7. I kind of miss those days of flying from DC to Los Angeles when I could set my phone to airplane mode. I still worked during the flight, but without the constant interruptions of text messages.\n\nS+B: Will this way of doing business continue beyond the pandemic?\nMCKISSACK: We’re going to emerge with some type of hybrid, depending on the various functions of a business. I have already had one major client tell me that 80 percent of its staff will not be going back to the office, so we are redesigning that corporation’s physical spaces to match this new reality, with more open spaces and reconfigured areas to minimize traffic and close gatherings.\n\nIn our company, design groups like to get together, so we will provide office space for that purpose, but most of our management teams, from finance to marketing, will continue to do business virtually. Except for construction, we’ve gone from a face-to-face, handshake-deal business to a tech-based industry where everything is touchless, using innovative software and AI.\n\nAcross industries, far fewer people will be flying to make deals in person, and many offices will get much smaller, by 50 percent or more. In the case of our firm, we’ll likely go back to working in person part-time, for meetings, something that we are beginning to do. But as we take a hard look at the physical conditions of any space for safety, comfort, and compliance, I’d also like to scale our own headquarters to 20 percent of its current capacity.\n\nS+B: Are these trends also changing commercial real estate?\nMCKISSACK: Yes. Developers are going to move toward more residential projects because now people are doing all their living and working at home. Their office is their house, and that trend is here to stay because people like this flexibility. The end result is that the home layout is going to change, and that’s where the opportunity is. We’re also seeing more existing office real estate convert to beautiful living spaces, like the Tribune Tower Residences in Chicago.\n\nS+B: What about the role of sustainability, particularly as we adapt to a post–COVID-19 world?\nMCKISSACK: One of the unintended results of the lockdowns and working from home has been cleaner air and lower emissions. But sustainability has always been a main tenet of everything we do in design, engineering, and construction management. Sustainable building practices involve everything from design and management processes to technologies, machinery, materials, supply chains, and building systems. We’re always looking for ways to improve and have been early adopters of best practices and, in some cases, pioneers as it relates to supply chains, sources, processes, procedures, and design.\n\nWe don’t design the systems, but we provide design services and program and project management for various specialty projects. For example, we work on projects that dewater the sludge that comes out of wastewater plants, and we are especially committed to jobs that will get wastewater plants to net zero.\n\nS+B: As you’ve navigated these industry trends, what is the most important lesson you have learned about your organization?\nMCKISSACK: My leaders have all stepped up to the plate, calming the anxiety of our staff. We instituted a series of virtual town halls to talk about how we were all feeling. For the first, I asked everyone to write a gratitude statement, and the results were beautiful. By the second town hall, the George Floyd killing had happened, so I brought in an executive coach to lead a discussion on unconscious bias. People need to have conversations to see if there’s similarity in how they’re feeling, so I implemented “speed talks” where people could go into a virtual room to talk for five minutes. It brought people in Texas face to face with people in L.A., and L.A. folks with colleagues in DC, enabling many who had never met in person to connect.\n\nEven though we were all working remotely, the technology created an intimacy among our workforce that didn’t exist before. We also hired a coach to lead six sessions on being humble, hungry, and smart. We wanted to take the time to build a healthy team, and to figure out how we could come out of this better, and how we could help others as we’re helping ourselves.\n\nS+B: Have you been able to draw from your experiences as a minority business founder and leader?\nMCKISSACK: I’ve had to go through so much adversity, but I just kept working through it, staying on my path. Having experienced discrimination, with people always trying to define me, “no” means absolutely nothing to me. It just made me more determined to set my own direction. A bad storm doesn’t deter me, because I know I can get to the other side. I’ve had to do that so many times.\n\nThe diversity of our organization is helping us get through these extraordinary times. Another reason I started my own business was that when I worked for non-minority-owned companies, I never had a seat at the table. But at my company, no one is being dismissed or ignored because of their gender or race. We want to hear from everybody, because getting all those unique perspectives makes a difference and makes us better. We won’t necessarily take everyone’s ideas, but we might put them together to come up with a hybrid. It helps prevent stagnation and groupthink. And this diversity of experiences fosters greater innovation, which leads to greater organizational resilience going forward. It also means we have the ingenuity in-house to adapt to this new world post–COVID-19.\n\nS+B: How can other companies build more diversity and inclusion into their workforce and culture?\nMCKISSACK: The architecture, engineering, and construction industry could do a lot better, especially when it comes to women and minorities in executive and board roles. There have been plenty of panels discussing systemic racism in our industry. But now we need action. We need to close the gap by hiring more women and minorities. Our procurement practices need to promote more minority firms. And we need to work with the underserved communities where we are building. Help those you’re disrupting. Buy lunch and eat in the neighborhood where you are working.\n\nGreat leadership is humble. But being humble does not mean you are weak. It means you are so confident that you don’t mind hearing the truth about yourself, so that you can change.",

        "Being an entrepreneur is hard. Period.\n\nJust because Zucks put on a hoodie and became a billionaire doesn’t mean everyone else can. Sure, if you’ve got the chops, there’s no question that this day and age has provided us the tools to build something both quickly and cost-effectively. But, that doesn’t mean everybody should do it. It’s funny to me how quickly people can realize that they’re not a Kobe or Beyonce, but for some reason, they’re able to convince themselves they’re an entrepreneur and can build a million-dollar business.\n\nFor over the last half-decade, we’ve been living through a narrative that has glorified entrepreneurship. The story that’s been depicted in movies like The Social Network has convinced people that they could (and should) go and start a business. But, by doing this, I’m afraid that a lot of you aren’t putting yourselves in the best positions to succeed. Not only might you be wasting time, but you’re also hurting your reputation and brand equity while losing people’s money along the way. Instead of progressing yourselves professionally, what you’re actually doing is stunting your growth in a time where you could have been an incredible number two, three, or four in a great organization and setting yourself up for more long-term upside.\n\nLook at the facts. LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr — Recognize those names? That’s 7 (7!!!) notable companies built in a 12-year window that everyone’s convinced they can mimic. In the time that it takes you to read this article, 27 more companies were started and almost all will fail. That’s a problem. Why does everyone think they can start the next big thing when it’s statistically improbable they’ll create the next unicorn? Look at the math. It’s against you.\n\nAnd, to even be “successful” you don’t need the “millions.” Because when you really look at the numbers, on average, an income of $155,000 a year puts you in the top 10% of all income earners in the U.S. That’s likely lower than what you would have thought, right? Well, that’s the data. That’s the truth. So this notion of “I need to make a ‘billi’ or bust,” is just impractical.\n\nAnd so, for those of you looking to start your own venture, you need to start by asking yourself, “Why am I even going down this route in the first place?” The answer is happiness, because that’s the truth. Would you rather make $70K running your own thing, dictating your own income, happy as hell, or make $100K at a job you hate?\n\nAnd so, all I’m asking here is that we reframe the conversation. Because, the only way for any of this to work is for you to start with your north star and reverse engineer from there given the context of who you are and what you want out of this one shot we’ve all got.\n\nIn entrepreneurship, there’s no magic formulas. No 9-week process to make you a millionaire. No secret-holding $3,000 ebook that was written by someone who’s never built a business besides the one that “teaches” you how to build one. That shit’s not real. It takes work. Hard work. And those “millions” we see see in the headlines? They’re not realistic either. They’re just not. But that doesn’t mean we can’t be happy while doing it. We just need to understand why we’re doing the things we’re doing, because:\n\nHow you make your money is way more important than how much you make.\n\nWe live in a day and time where anyone with passion and love for something can build a business around it. And, although that might sound cliché because the thought has been bastardized, it’s just true. The internet has opened us all to a world of opportunity but we need to be honest with ourselves in understanding what we’re seeking. You just need to be practical and self-aware. Because 30, 40, 60 years from now, you’re not going to regret the few extra bucks you could have made. You’re going to regret not focusing your time and energy around the things that could have made you happy.",

        "“Netflix sounded a little porny, but it was the best we could do.”\n\nThose were the exact words Netflix’s Co-founder, Marc Randolph, used to answer the question of how they came up with the name Netflix.\n\nIn a recent podcast interview with Mindvalley’s Vishen Lakhiani, Marc shared with us the story behind how Netflix went from concept to company.\n\nHe traveled way back in time to when he and his eventual co-founder Reed Hastings would carpool in the Bay area and, every day, Marc would pitch Reed a new business idea. Some ideas were not so great — customized baseball bats and customized shampoo. Other ideas transformed into something much greater — Netflix.\n\nMarc Randolph was 38 years old when he started Netflix, but he had successfully launched over five ventures beforehand.\n\nHere are 5 pieces of advice from the co-founder of Netflix, a company founded in 1998, that is now generating over 20.16 billion USD in annual revenue.\n\n1. Start now and start small; never leave an idea in your head.There’s nothing more damaging to aspiring entrepreneurs than mere inaction. I can attest to this myself as I spent the entirety of my mid-twenties talking about starting a business, but I never did.\nIn 2011, at a university competition, I delivered a two-minute elevator pitch about a food-delivery app, won second place, but I did nothing about it. All throughout my time working at Google, all I did with my close friends was entertain start-up ideas, but we never put them in action.\nThat’s why, as soon as I resigned, my single top priority was to finally start a project on my own. And within one year of doing so, I witnessed the greatest professional and personal growth in my life.\nHere’s the single most important advice Marc Randolph has for you: Stop talking about your ideas or entertaining them in your head.\n\nStop talking and start doing.\n\n“You have to figure out how to quickly, easily, and cheaply get your idea out of your head and collide it with reality.”\n\nEvery idea you have in your head sounds like the next big thing. And the more you think about it, the bigger it becomes. But here’s a reality check: It isn’t. Your idea is incredibly flawed because it has yet to be subject to outside forces. It has yet to solve a person’s problem.\n\nSo how do you start?\n\nIn his chat with Vishen, Marc gives an example of a university student who once approached him with the idea to build a peer-to-peer clothing-rental business. His solution was quite simple.\nHe asked her for a pen and a piece of paper and prepared a sign that read:\n“Need to borrow clothes? Knock.”\nHe then told her to slap it on her dorm-room door and see what happens. Just by doing so, and within a few hours, she’ll be able to find out whether or not the idea is viable. If someone knocks, it is.\nHow to apply this:\nMarc’s advice comes down to three simple steps:\nGet your flawed idea out of your head and put it on paper. Your idea doesn't need to be viable, as Marc explains, “it just needs to be something that stimulates what the problem is you’re really trying to solve.”\nGet over that fear that keeps you from starting. Here’s one small mental shift to help you do so.\nGet busy testing your idea so you can figure out the flaws in it. Once your idea is in public, as people engage with it, you begin to identify the flaws in it, which then allows you to reflect, reformulate, and rebuild. So don’t get lost in the branding just yet, prioritize shipping your product so you can further explore the validity of the problem it solves.\n“It’s a way to get started. If you’re waiting to hire someone, you’re wasting your time. If you’re waiting to complete some education, you’re wasting your time. If you’re waiting to raise money, you’re wasting your time. Start!”\nYour objective is to learn how people will engage with your idea to determine whether your core concept is viable. And you only learn so by testing it.\n\n2. The magic lies not in the idea, it lies in the testing process.\nThis second lesson is the reason why Marc’s number one piece of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is to just start; because once you do, you’ll come to realize that the magic does not lie in your idea, it lies in your testing process.\n“It’s not about having good ideas. It’s about the system, the process, and culture for testing lots of bad ones.”\nImplementation is everything.\nThat’s exactly why James Clear has become so famous for saying that “you do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Likewise, in entrepreneurship, you do not rise to the level of your ideas, you fall to the level of your systems.\nThis is another lesson I learned in my first year of entrepreneurship: You’re only as good as your systems and processes. And that’s exactly why in my second venture of building a writing business, the first thing I did was build myself a writing system that would allow me to rise to the level of my goals.\nHow to apply this:\nIn a fast-moving world, you need to move faster.\nFind a cheap, quick, and clever way to build systems that would allow you to continually test and retest your ideas. As Marc explains: “The trick is not having the idea. The trick is how quickly and how cheaply and how easily and how cleverly you can figure out a way to take an idea and test it.”\n\n3. Culture is not what you say, it’s what you do.\nThis lesson is short and simple, but it’s implications are profound. When asked about Netflix’s culture, Marc replied with this:\n“Culture is not what you say. Culture is what you do.”\nIt’s not about your aspirations or inspirations, it’s about how you behave. How you carry yourself. How you treat yourself, your co-founder, your employees, and your customers. Stop talking about your principles, start modeling them.\nIn essence, Marc’s words echo what Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of my favorite thinkers, wrote decades ago: “What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.”\nHow to apply this:\nIt’s really simple. Say what you’re going to do and be accountable for it.\n\n4. Think long-term by focusing on what not do to today.\nMarc shares the story of how long before Netflix became an online streaming service, they not only rented DVDs, they also sold them. And, at one point in time, 90% of their revenues came from selling DVDs.\nIt was there when the founders found themselves at a junction point.\nThey knew that it was just a matter of time before other companies would start selling DVDs, which would transform their business into a commodity-based model and thus reduce their margins. They also realized that their recent focus on DVD sales was distracting them from fully focusing on their core model of attaining rental rights.\nThe question was: “Where do you go from here?”\nDo you focus on what’s paying your salary and driving 90% of your revenue? Or do you focus on the ultimate long-term goal of the business — the rental service (even if it’s showing no signs that it’s working)?\nWell, I guess you know what happened next.\nThey said they were all in. So they walked away entirely from selling DVDs, slashed 90% of their business, and focused solely on growing their rental model. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n“That’s the nature of being an entrepreneur. You’re prepared, and more interested frankly, in taking the long-shot at what could be a big success, rather than taking the safe route toward mediocrity, or more likely, failure.”\nHow to apply this:\nIf you want to succeed in entrepreneurship, you must be willing to do two things. First, you must choose your sacrifices. Second, you must always play the long-game. How? You focus on one thing and get that one thing right. Why? Because doing too many things slows you down.\n“It’s really hard, but fundamentally, one of the hardest decisions you’re going to ever have to make is what you’re not going to do.”\nThe biggest mistake I made in my first entrepreneurial venture was that I had no focus. I launched an eCommerce store that offers plastic-free products, but I didn’t focus on one product or try to validate the next one. I wanted to sell everything to everyone, so I expanded too prematurely, too enthusiastically, and too quickly. An amateur’s mistake, until I landed on this Russian Proverb:\n“If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.”\nMake it a habit to think long-term and to focus on one thing and become great at it before considering expanding into something else. And here’s a tip shared by Marc that can get you started: For every meeting that revolves around what you’re thinking about doing next, start that meeting with a discussion about what you’re going to stop doing first.\n\n5. Find balance, or you will crash.\nAs the conversation came to an end, Vishen asked Marc this question:\n“What’s your biggest passion right now?”\nHis answer will shock you:\n“From the very beginning, my big focus has been on balance. Since I was in my twenties, I’ve learned — and it dawned on me — that I was not a whole person if I was working all the time.”\nHe explains how every Tuesday he steps out the door at 5.00 pm sharp to have dinner with his wife. And how he regularly goes mountain biking and cross-country skiing. He does what makes him whole and happy.\n“So, what am I interested in?” continues Marc, “It’s mastering balance.” Every end of the week, end of the month, and end of the year, he looks back to reflect on his progress and answer the question of “how did I do?”\nHow to apply this:\nManage your energy first because what good can you do if you’re totally exhausted?\nTrust me, when I say this, burnout will break you. It took me less than six months of constant hustle, non-stop work, sleepless nights, zero social life, and an exuberant amount of overthinking for me to hit the wall crashing.\nThat was when I decided that I was done; I removed the word hustle from my dictionary and replaced it with ‘slow living and mindful consistency.’ I slowed down, put my health first, and created more balance in my life.\nSo make a vow with yourself to create balance in your life. Identify what balance means to you and what it looks like in your life. And once you do, embody it. As explained before, culture is what you do, not what you say. So don’t say you want to live a balanced life. Commit to one and live it.\nAnswer this question:\n“What makes me whole?”\nThen go and make time for it.\nWhat Matters to You\nIn the lessons above, Marc Randolph bestows on us his brilliant wisdom:\nNever leave an idea in your head — start now and start small.\nBuild systems that facilitate a continuous testing process.\nRemember that culture is what you do, not what you say.\nFocus on one thing (your core competency), get good at it, and always play the long-game.\nPrioritize balance in your life so you can stay whole and happy.\nAll the above are great lessons, but the one below rises above all. As Marc was explaining the importance of finding balance, he said the following:\n“You can’t have business success be the metric of success in your life.”\nThere’s much more to life than business.\nAs you walk the path of entrepreneurship, never forget to count your blessings or stay mindful of what matters most in life: The gift of being alive, your relationships with family and close friends, and the appreciation for the free beauty that lives all around you in nature.",

        "Recently we hosted a Q&A at Asana that I participated in with Ben Horowitz, Matt Cohler, and Justin Rosenstein. Marcus Wohlsen from Wired attended and wrote an article that discussed our views on the culture of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. This is an important topic, so I want to take some time to clarify what we meant in this blog post. Before I do, I’d like to emphasize that we were talking exclusively about Silicon Valley culture and not the more general ‘small business entrepreneur.’ So for our audience at the time, entrepreneur meant “Silicon Valley startup technology entrepreneur.”\n\nEven given that context, it is notable that we all said you “probably” shouldn’t be an entrepreneur, not that you definitely shouldn’t. This is explicitly a directional position; we believe there are too many startups and entrepreneurs in the SV ecosystem, but that is very different from saying there shouldn’t be any. Many people think there should be more, and we are counterbalancing that view. Whenever you counterbalance an extreme view, you tend to also come off extremely, and certainly do in the media (which is related to the point I made about integration in my last post).\n\nThe reason we like best for becoming an entrepreneur is that you are extremely passionate about an idea and believe that starting a new company is the best way to bring it into the world. The passion is important because entrepreneurship is hard and you’ll need it to endure the struggle, as well as to convince other people to help you. Believing that starting a new company is the best way to bring it into the world is important to ensure that resources—including most importantly your own time — are being put to the best possible use. If the idea is best brought into the world by an existing team, then it is tautologically optimal for the world for it to happen that way. Of course, not everyone is actually trying to optimize their impact, but many entrepreneurs are, by their own admission, and it is important for those people to consider this angle.\n\nIf you’re not trying to maximize impact, then it seems like a reasonable assumption that you are instead optimizing around personal lifestyle preferences of some kind. You want total freedom to choose how you make your living, regardless of if it necessarily provide large amounts of value to other people or perhaps is even redundant with something that already exists. Or you want extreme flexibility in your schedule, maybe including the ability to stop working altogether for long periods of time at short notice. Or you want to work on a certain kind of problem or with certain kinds of people. For many kinds of preference, you likely can actually find a company able to give them to you, but certainly starting your own is a great shortcut and I personally think that’s totally reasonable. I like people who are seeking to have big impact on the world, but it is not the only path worth taking, and I have no reason to denigrate this type of entrepreneur.\n\nSo with all that in mind, here are some of the bad reasons to become an entrepreneur that we were actually trying to speak to:\n\nYou want to be your own boss in a big company. Evernote CEO Phil Libin put it well last year:\n“People have this vision of being the CEO of a company they started and being on top of the pyramid. Some people are motivated by that, but that’s not at all what it’s like.\nWhat it’s really like: everyone else is your boss – all of your employees, customers, partners, users, media are your boss. I’ve never had more bosses and needed to account for more people today.\nThe life of most CEOs is reporting to everyone else, at least that’s what it feels like to me and most CEOs I know. If you want to exercise power and authority over people, join the military or go into politics. Don’t be an entrepreneur.”\n\nYou think it’s glamorous. The media does a great job idolizing various entrepreneurs, crowning Kings and designating Godfathers of various mafias, but this is all colorful narrative. The reality is years of hard work, throughout which you usually have no idea if you’re even moving in the right direction.\n\nYou believe you’re extremely talented and that this is the way to maximize your financial return on that talent. Why wouldn’t you want more of the cap table? This is flawed logic, since the 100th engineer at Facebook made far more money than 99% of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Small slices of gigantic pies are still themselves gigantic. If you’re extremely talented, you can easily identify a company with high growth potential and relatively low risk and get an aggressive compensation package from them. If you turn out to be wrong after a few years, you can try again. Within 2 or 3 tries, and likely on the first one, you’ll have a great outcome and can be confident you contributed serious lasting value to the world. If you instead try to immediately start “the next Google or Facebook”, there is a very high likelihood that you will fail completely, or be forced to settle for a much smaller outcome. It will take a long time to reach success or failure, so you won’t have many tries.\n\nYou heard Paul Graham compared non-founders to animals at a zoo and don’t want to look like a chump (or a chimp). As Jeff Atwood points out, this is much more projection than fact. There are companies that feel like they were lifted out of a Dilbert cartoon and treat their employees terribly and then there are, you know, good companies. Work for one of those, or work for yourself, but definitely don’t work anywhere that you can describe as “soul-sucking”.\n\nYes, this viewpoint is somewhat self-serving. We want to hire the best at Asana, and many of the best are choosing to become entrepreneurs instead of applying at companies like ours. That said, we only need to hire a quite small number of those folks to ourselves succeed. The bigger concern is the macro effect of spreading talent too thinly across the board and the micro effect of people not spending their time in valuable ways. Zuck himself has speculated that Silicon Valley is not obviously the place he would start a company like Facebook today for exactly this reason. As to the micro effect, I like the way Justin puts it: “If you’re going to devote the best years of your life to your work, have enough love for yourself and the world around you to work on something that matters to you deeply”.",

But, who is counting?\n\nLet’s have a candid conversation about entrepreneurship vs. “employee-ship”.\nI want to begin by saying the dream to become an entrepreneur isn’t a silly one… not in the least.\nAfter all, I chose that path for myself and that decision has allowed me to build Jotform to almost 4 million users over the last 12 years… and it has given me the chance to work with a team of incredible people… a team of incredible employees.\nHowever, I would be remiss if I didn’t say the dream to become an “employee” isn’t a silly one either. In fact, there is a great deal of me that would argue it’s a better one for some people.\nHelp build an already established company (vs. lose sleep over thinking of all the entrepreneurial risks you took)?\nEarn a hefty salary (vs. worry how on earth you’ll be able take care of your family for the rest of your life)?\nHave the chance to one day move up the ranks (vs. embrace a completely uncertain future)?\nEnjoy paid time off and other benefits (vs. burn yourself out in a culture that celebrates the 80-hour hustle)?\nWhere do I sign up?\nUnfortunately, in the twenty-first century, “employee-ship” seemed to have gotten a bad rap, all of a sudden being a “9–5’er” became uncool… that aspiring to work for a company versus build one of your own somehow makes you small-minded, unmotivated or a follower. I totally disagree.\nThe story about Sarah above (her name and the companies name have been changed for privacy purposes) highlights some of the benefits employees get to enjoy that most entrepreneurs don’t… until they “make it” (or if they ever make it).\nWhile I’m not naive to think that Sarah’s experience is every employee’s experience, hitting a home run and selling your company for a billion dollars isn’t every entrepreneur’s experience either — just a select few unicorns like Instagram.\nWe need to talk more about the real cost of entrepreneurship and our worrying “Hustle until the haters ask if you’re hiring” mentality.\n\nEntrepreneurship doesn’t always lead to happiness, flexibility, wealth and notoriety.\nDon't become an entrepreneur Image-1\n“I’ll be happy when”… is a thought that has ironically caused much unhappiness for men and women chasing anything in this world.\nWe find ourselves running after something — marriage, kids, a bigger house, a nicer car — and when we finally catch the thing we’re chasing, we find ourselves still feeling a bit empty.\nIn psychology, this concept is called “focusing illusion”, it’s a cognitive bias where people place too much emphasis on a future event and as a result inaccurately predict the reality of the event.\nThink about a time you’ve told yourself a story about a goal or dream you were going after and in your head it looked like a fairy tale… but once you actually achieved the goal or dream the reality was far less epic.\nThat’s focusing illusion.\nIn “Why setting big goals can make you miserable”, I explained it using the concept of “post-marathon syndrome”, a well-documented state of sadness, worthlessness and letdown. It’s a natural human reaction.\nMany aspiring entrepreneurs suffer from such a psychological phenomenon. They tell themselves stories of what life as an entrepreneur will be like… but once they actually live the life of an entrepreneur they discover the reality is anything but.\nOften times, these stories come in the form of “I’ll be happy when…”\nI’ll be happy when… I start a business.\nI will be happy when… I am making $100,000 a year from my business.\nI will be happy when… I sell my business and become a milllionaire.\nI will be happy when… [fill in the blank].\nOne story aspiring entrepreneurs tell themselves is that they will be happy when they find some of the many myths associated with entrepreneurship — flexibility, wealth, notoriety, etc.\nBut, from my own experience as an entrepreneur, these illusions aren’t discovered or achieved through entrepreneurship:\nI will be happy when I have more Flexibility as an entrepreneur — my life hasn’t become more flexible after building Jotform (and it wasn’t anything close to flexible during the first ten or so years while building it). After 12 years, my responsibility today is only bigger… managing, hiring, strategizing and worrying.\nIf, as an entrepreneur, you’re working 40 hours a week and “worrying” an additional 40 hours outside of work… is your life truly flexible?\nI will be happy when I have greater Wealth as an entrepreneur — while Jotform has been a modest success for myself and my team, for every modest entrepreneurial success, there are thousands of failures. And, regardless of the Cinderella stories you hear in the media, the reality of entrepreneurial failure is anything but a fairy tale. There’s nothing poetic about going tens of thousands of dollars in debt because your dream didn’t take off. Where it concerns entrepreneurship, I would argue that wealth isn’t something that should be expected… I’d argue it’s a rare exception. In fact, according to this study, the average entrepreneur makes roughly $5/ hour starting out and established entrepreneurs make $62/ hour. Yes, that’s good money, but far from being a millionaire.\nI will be happy when I have more Notoriety as an entrepreneur — another misconception of entrepreneurship is that it leads to notoriety or fame. While yes, some entrepreneurs like Musk and Zuckerberg are celebrated like rock stars, most of us go completely unnoticed. Instead of trying to make it to a magazine cover, I choose picking olives and spending quality time with my family.\nSo, when you truly look at flexibility, wealth and notoriety… you realize that entrepreneurship isn’t necessarily the best path to take to achieve these things.\nEntrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. Just because it’s cool or you are born to become an entrepreneur doesn’t mean your friends should become one.\nIf you want more flexibility, you might as well work for a remote-friendly company. If you seek wealth, you might as well make money working in real estate, sales or investment banking.\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with these things, they can’t necessarily be found through entrepreneurship… or at least it’s not the easiest path to find them.\nBefore making the choice to become an entrepreneur (or an employee for that matter), we can ask ourselves what will truly make us happy and be extremely realistic with ourselves… because it might just be focusing illusion getting the better of us.",
